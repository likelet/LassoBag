\arguments{
\item{ExpressionData}{ExpressionData is an object constructed by SummarizedExperiment. It contains the independent variables matrix and outcome variables matrix.}

\item{outcomevariable}{Variables which must be the column name of the outcome variables matrix were used to construct models.}

\item{observed.fre}{dataframe with columns 'variable' and 'Frequency',
which can be obtained from existed VSOLassoBag results for re-analysis. A
warning will be issued if the variables in `observed.fre` not found in `mat`,
and these variables will be excluded.}

\item{bootN}{the size of re-sampled samples for bagging, default 1000; smaller
consumes less processing time but may not get robust results.}

\item{boot.rep}{whether sampling with return or not in the bagging procedure}

\item{sample.size}{The sample size in the bagging space, default is 1 (same sample size as the input sample size).}

\item{a.family}{a character determine the data type of out.mat, the same used
in \code{\link[glmnet]{glmnet}}.}

\item{additional.covariable}{provide additional covariable(s) to build the cox
model, only valid in Cox method (`a.family` == "cox"); a data.frame with same
rows as `mat`}

\item{bagFreq.sigMethod}{a character to determine the cut-off point decision
method for the importance measure (i.e. the observed selection frequency).
Supported methods are "Parametric Statistical Test" (abbr. "PST"),
"Curve Elbow Point Detection" ("CEP") and "Permutation Test" ("PERT").
The default and preferable method is "CEP". The method "PERT" is not
recommended due to consuming time and memmory requirement.}

\item{kneedle.S}{numeric, an important parameter that determines how aggressive
the elbow points on the curve to be called, smaller means more aggressive and
may find more elbow points. Default `kneedle.S`=10 seems fine, but feel free to
try other values. The selection of `kneedle.S` should be based on the shape of
observed frequency curve. It is suggested to use larger S first.}

\item{auto.loose}{if TRUE, will reduce `kneedle.S` in case no elbow point is
found with the set `kneedle.S`; only valid when `bagFreq.sigMethod` is "Curve
Elbow Point Detection" ("CEP").}

\item{loosing.factor}{a numeric value range in (0,1), which `kneedle.S` is
multiplied by to reduce itself; only valid when `auto.loose` set to TRUE.}

\item{min.S}{a numeric value determines the minimal value that `kneedle.S` will
be loosed to; only valid when `auto.loose` set to TRUE.}

\item{use.gpd}{whether to fit Generalized Pareto Distribution to the
permutation results to accelerate the process. Only valid when
`bagFreq.sigMethod` is "Permutation Test" ("PERT").}

\item{fit.pareto}{the method of fitting Generalized Pareto Distribution,
default choice is "gd", for gradient descend, and alternative as "mle", for
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (only valid in "PERT" mode).}

\item{imputeN}{the initial permutation times (only valid in "PERT" mode).}

\item{imputeN.max}{the max permutation times. Regardless of whether p-value has
meet the requirement (only valid in "PERT" mode).}

\item{permut.increase}{if the initial imputeN times of permutation doesn't meet
the requirement, then we add â€˜permut.increase times of permutation to get more
random/permutation values (only valid in "PERT" mode).}

\item{parallel}{whether the script run in parallel mode; you also need to set
n.cores to determine how much CPU resource to use.}

\item{n.cores}{how many threads/process to be assigned for this function; more
threads used results in more resource of CPU and memory used.}

\item{nfolds}{integer > 2, how many folds to be created for n-folds
cross-validation LASSO in \code{\link[glmnet]{cv.glmnet}}.}

\item{lambda.type}{character, which model should be used to obtain the
variables selected in one bagging. Default is "lambda.1se" for less variables
selected and lower probability being over-fitting. See the help of `cv.glmnet`
for more details.}

\item{plot.freq}{whether to show all the non-zero frequency in the final
barplot or not. If "full", all the variables(including zero frequency) will be
plotted. If "part", all the non-zero variables will be plotted. If "not", will
not print the plot.}

\item{plot.out}{the file's name of the frequency plot. If set to FALSE, no plot
will be output. If you run this function in Linux command line, you don't have
to set this param for the plot.freq will output your plot to your current
working directory with name "Rplot.pdf".Default to FALSE.}

\item{do.plot}{if TRUE generate result plots.}

\item{output.dir}{the path to save result files generated by
\code{\link[VSOLassoBag]{VSOLassoBag}} (if not existed, will be created).
Default is NA, will save in the same space as the current working dir.}

\item{filter.method}{the filter method applied to input matrix; default is
`auto`, automatically select the filter method according to the data type of
`out.mat`. Specific supported methods are "pearson", "spearman", "kendall"
from \code{\link{cor.test}} method, and "cox" from \code{\link{coxph}} method,
and "none" (no filter applied).}

\item{inbag.filter}{if TRUE, apply filters to the re-sampled bagging samples
rather than the original samples; default is TRUE.}

\item{filter.thres.method}{the method determines the threshold of importance
in filters. Supported methods are "fdr" and "rank".}

\item{filter.thres.P}{if `filter.thres.method` is "fdr", use `filter.thres.P`
as the (adjusted) cut-off p-value. Default is 0.05.}

\item{filter.rank.cutoff}{if `filter.thres.method` is "rank", use
`filter.rank.cutoff` as the cut-off rank. Default is 0.05.}

\item{filter.min.variables}{minimum important variables selected by filters.
Useful when building a multi-variable cox model since cox model can only be
built on limited variables. Default is -Inf (not applied).}

\item{filter.max.variables}{maximum important variables selected by filters.
Useful when building a multi-variable cox model since cox model can only be
built on limited variables. Default is Inf (not applied).}

\item{filter.result.report}{if TRUE generate filter reports for filter results,
only vaild when `inbag.filter` set to FALSE (i.e. only valid in out-bag filters
mode).}

\item{filter.report.all.variables}{if TRUE report all variables in the filter
report, only valid when `filter.result.report` set to TRUE.}

\item{post.regression}{build a regression model based on the variables selected
by VSOLassoBag process. Default is FALSE.}

\item{post.LASSO}{build a LASSO regression model based on the variables
selected by VSOLassoBag process, only vaild when `post.regression` set to TRUE.}

\item{pvalue.cutoff}{determine the cut-off p-value for what variables were
selected by VSOLassoBag, only vaild when `post.regression` is TRUE and
`bagFreq.sigMethod` set to "Parametric Statistical Test" or "Permutation Test".}

\item{used.elbow.point}{determine which elbow point to use if multiple elbow
points were detected for what variables were selected by VSOLassoBag. Supported
methods are "first", "middle" and "last". Default is "middle", use the middle
one among all detected elbow points. Only vaild when `post.regression` is TRUE
and `bagFreq.sigMethod` set to "Curve Elbow Point Detection".}
}
\value{
A list with (1) the result dataframe, "results", contains "variable" with
selection frequency >=1 and their "Frequency", the "P.value" and the adjusted
p value "P.adjust" of each variable (if set `bagFreq.sigMethod` = "PST" or
"PERT"), or the elbow point indicators "elbow.point", while elbow point(s)
will be marked with "*" (if set `bagFreq.sigMethod` = "CEP"). This is the main
result VSOLassoBag obtained. (2) other utility results, including permutation
results, "permutations", the regression model built on VSOLassoBag results,
"model".
}
\description{
An one-step function that can be easily utilized for selecting
important variables from multiple models inherited from R package \emph{glmnet}.
Several methods (Parametric Statistical Test, Curve Elbow Point Detection and
Permutation Test)  are provided for the cut-off point decision of the importance
measure (i.e. observed selection frequency) of variables.
